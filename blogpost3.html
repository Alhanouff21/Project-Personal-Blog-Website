              <h2>UDACITY’S NANODEGREE SCHOLARSHIPS</h2>
              <p>Published on <time>July 24, 2022</time> by <a href="https://medium.com/@alexandraighodaro">Alexandra Ighodaro</a></p>

              <p id="first">Within 6 months, I benefited from two Udacity scholarships and I would like you to benefit from them as well. </p>
    
              <p>Udacity is a digital learning platform that helps lifelong learners learn the skills they need to land the jobs they want and build the lives they deserve. Udacity has a vast range of free courses. Those free courses usually last between one to eight weeks and they don’t come with certificates.</p>
    
             
    
              <p>The Nanodegree scholarship is a cost-free method of paying for a Nanodegree program at Udacity. Click here to view the available scholarship options. To stay up to date on the available scholarships, follow Udacity on LinkedIn and Twitter as applications are currently closed for the below scholarships except for the AWS-sponsored scholarships.</p>

              <p>To know the Udacity scholarships to watch out for, here is a list of some Udacity scholarships and the programs they cover: </p>

             <ol>
                <li>Accenture Scholarship Program: This covers full tuition for the Intro to Programming and Predictive Analytics for Business Nanodegree.</li>
                <li>Access Bank’s Advance Africa Scholarship Program: This covers full tuition for Business Analytics, Programming for Data Science with Python, Digital Marketing, Product Management, and Intro to Programming Nanodegree.</li>
                <li> AWS AI & ML Scholarship: This covers full tuition for AI and ML, AI Programming with Python Nanodegree Program.</li>
                <li> Aspire to Tech Scholarship: This covers full tuition for Android Basics, Front End Web Developer, and Intro to Programming Nanodegree.</li>
                <li>Bertelsmann Technology Scholarship Program: This covers full tuition for Artificial Intelligence, Data, and Cloud Learning Tracks.</li>
              </ol>
             
              <p>You should know that the application process for the above scholarships varies and depends on the sponsors. Different sponsors have different ways of picking their scholarship awardees.</p>
              <p>In December 2021, I applied for the Programming for Data Science Nanodegree through Access Bank’s Advance Africa Scholarship by filling out an online form. In January 2022, I was accepted into a one-month SQL challenge course. After completion, I wrote an assessment based on the challenge course. From the assessment result, top students were awarded the scholarship and we started the Nanodegree program in March and ended in May.</p>
              <p>Immediately after completing the first Nanodegree, I was awarded the ALX-T Data Analyst Nanodegree scholarship in May. Unlike the Access Bank’s Advance Africa Scholarship, the ALX-T application has an immediate SQL and Python-based assessment instead of a one-month challenge course.</p>
