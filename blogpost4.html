             <p id="first">Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a free and open-source code editor that supports a wide range of languages, platforms, and features. It is one of the most popular and versatile editors for developers, especially for those who work with Flutter, the UI toolkit for building fast, beautiful, and natively compiled applications for mobile, web, desktop, and embedded devices. </p>
    
             <p>In this article, I will share why VS Code is my favorite IDE and what are the best extensions that I use to enhance my Flutter development experience.</p>
    
             <h2>Why VS Code?</h2>
    
             <p>There are many reasons why I prefer VS Code over other IDEs, but here are some of the main ones:</p>

              <ul>
                <li><span>Lightweight and fast:</span> VS Code is lightweight and fast, which means it does not consume a lot of resources or slow down my computer. It also has a smooth and responsive user interface that makes coding enjoyable and productive.</li>
                <li><span>Customizable and extensible:</span> VS Code is highly customizable and extensible, which means I can tailor it to my preferences and needs. I can change the layout, the icons, the fonts, the color scheme, and more. I can also install extensions to add new languages, themes, debuggers, and tools to VS Code. There are thousands of extensions available on the VS Code Marketplace that can enhance my coding experience..</li>
                <li><span> Integrated Git and debugging:</span> VS Code has built-in support for Git and debugging, which means I can easily manage my version control and test my code without leaving the editor. I can review diffs, stage files, make commits, push and pull from any hosted SCM service, set breakpoints, inspect variables, watch expressions, evaluate code, and more.</li>
                <li><span>IntelliSense and code completion:</span> VS Code has IntelliSense and code completion features that provide smart suggestions based on variable types, function definitions, and imported modules. This helps me write code faster and with fewer errors. VS Code also has syntax highlighting, code formatting, refactoring, linting, error checking, and other features that help me write clean and consistent code.</li>
                <li><span>Multi-platform support:</span>. This means I can use VS Code on any device or operating system that I want. It also means I can develop cross-platform applications with Flutter from a single codebase.</li>
              </ul>
            
             <h2>What are the best extensions for Flutter development?</h2>
              <p>VS Code has many extensions that can help me with Flutter development. Here are some of the best ones that I use: </p>

              <ul>
                <li><span>Flutter:</span> The official Flutter extension provides a rich set of tools for developing Flutter applications. It includes features such as hot reload, hot restart, stateful hot, widget inspector, devtools, test runner, project templates, snippets, documentation, and more. It also integrates with the Dart extension to provide syntax highlighting, code completion, refactoring, debugging, etc.</li>
                <li><span>Dart:</span> The official Dart extension provides support for the Dart programming language that is used to write Flutter applications. It includes features such as syntax highlighting, code completion, refactoring, debugging, testing, documentation, analysis server, etc. It also integrates with the Flutter extension to provide hot reload, hot restart, stateful hot reload, etc.</li>
                <li><span>Awesome Flutter Snippets:</span> This extension provides a collection of useful snippets for Flutter development. It includes snippets for creating widgets, animations, navigation, state management, networking, etc. It also includes snippets for common Dart features such as classes, functions, variables, etc.</li>
                <li><span>Flutter Widget Snippets: </span>The extension provides a collection of snippets for creating various widgets in Flutter. It includes snippets for creating basic widgets such as text, image, button, icon, etc. It also includes snippets for creating complex widgets such as listview, gridview, cardview, tabview, etc.</li>
                <li><span>Pubspec Assist: </span>This extension helps me manage my pubspec.yaml file, which is the configuration file for Flutter projects. It allows me to easily add, update, or remove dependencies, dev dependencies, assets, fonts, etc. It also provides autocomplete suggestions for package names and versions from pub.dev.</li>
                <li><span>Bracket Pair Colorizer 2:</span> An extension that helps me identify matching brackets in my code. It assigns different colors to different pairs of brackets, such as parentheses, curly braces, square brackets, etc. This makes it easier to see the structure and scope of my code.</li>
                <li><span>Material Icon Theme: </span>This extension provides a set of icons based on the Material Design guidelines for VS Code. It adds icons to files, folders, tabs, etc. that match the file type or name. This makes it easier to navigate and identify my files and folders.</li>
              </ul>
