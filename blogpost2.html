              <p id="first">It’s no lie that being a Data Scientist is arguably (in my humble opinion) one of the coolest jobs out there at the moment, especially with all the hype with AI this year. </p>
    
              <p>In this article, I want to walk you through my whole journey to becoming a Data Scientist, shedding some light and advice on how you can become one yourself!</p>
    
              <blockquote>
                <p>Quick note: My journey was to become a Data Scientist who specializes in Machine Learning. Data science means various things at different companies, so it’s important to understand what you want to be. However, for entry-level jobs, there is much muchness in this (a British saying).</p>

              <p>They seem to have their own moods and personalities. Weather watchers around the world are often transfixed by their variability.</p>

              <p>Coming from a physics background I pretty much had all the mathematical knowledge I needed: </p>

             <ul>
                <li>Linear Algebra: Matrices, Eigenvalues, etc</li>
                <li>Differentiation and Integration (Calculus)</li>
                <li>Basic Statistics: Probability distributions, Linear Regression</li>
              </ul>
             
              <p>The first course I took was Andrew Ng’s Machine Learning Specialization. I took it when it was still the 2012 version when the coding exercises were in Octave/Matlab.              </p>
              <p>Recently, it has been revamped and added more cutting-edge topics such as recommenders and reinforcement learning, and the exercises are all in Python</p>
              <p>This course taught me the fundamentals of all the machine learning algorithms. This was all before I even started implementing them in code. I think building that intuition behind the algorithms is so invaluable.</p>
