              <h3>Formation of Clouds </h3>
              <p>There are many types of clouds that are all generally formed in the same way
             - normally the sun heats the surface of the earth, causing invisible water vapor to rise that eventually condenses into visible water droplets or crystals to form clouds.For this to happen, the rising air must be saturated, in other words, not be able to hold any more water in vapor form. Saturation can happen in two ways:  </p>

             <ol>
                <li>by increasing the water content of the air, usually through evaporation to a point where the air can hold no more water vapor.</li>
                <li>most commonly, by cooling the air to the ‘dew point’, which is the point that the air can hold no more water causing condensation to happen. </li>
              </ol>
             
    
              <p>As the air rises, it expands in volume due to the lower atmospheric pressure. The energy used by this expansion causes the temperature to fall, and hence reach the dew point</p>
              
              <h2>Why are clouds white?</h2>
              <p>Clouds are white, the sun is orange and the sky is blue for the same reason. Light coming from the sun is actually white, though as it enters the confines of the earth’s atmosphere, small particles separate the blue light from the pure white sunlight, causing a blue sky and orange sun. The sky is slightly less blue at the horizon as the sunlight travels further through the atmosphere, further scattering the light wavelengths, and enabling some to re-combine to form larger levels of white light.</p>
              <p>However, the droplets of water are far larger in clouds, this means that all spectrums of sunlight are scattered almost equally, meaning that no separation occurs, and the pure white sunlight brightens the clouds. So next time you lookup into the clouds, imagine that you are actually looking at sunlight as it really is.</p>

              <h2>Fire-Breathing Dragon</h2>

              </figure>
              <p>Although the heating of the air is normally caused by gradual warming by the sun, other geographical factors can create a more dramatic heating effect - wildfires and volcanoes can create a heat source that causes the rapid formation of clouds known as pyrocumulus. If there is enough water vapor in the air, dramatic thunderstorms, pyrocumulonimbus, and lightning can happen. The anvil shaped pyrocumulonimbus clouds actually contain the smoke from the fires, and can reach five miles high. These storms can act as a ‘funnel’, and through an effect known as "pyroCb", can cause the previously earth-bound polluting particles to linger in the air, causing ill-effects to people and animals.</p>

              <h2>Fallstreak Hole</h2>
              <figure>

                <figcaption>Fallstreak clouds</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>This is a feature in a large circular or elliptical hole in a cirrocumulus or altocumulus cloud, and can be partially attributed to human behavior - namely flight.</p>
              <p>As aircraft pass through clouds formed of supercooled water droplets that still exist as liquid water below 0C. These water droplets need a small particle to be able to freeze when the temperature goes below -40C. When an aircraft passes through the droplets, the air passing over the wing experiences an expansion and rapid drop in temperature. This drop in temperature is sometimes enough to trigger the supercooled water droplets to freeze, form a ribbon of ice crystals following the plane’s path, and then fall out of the cloud. As the ice falls, it has the effect of creating other crystals that also fall from the sky by a process known as the Bergeron Effect, creating holes in the cloud.</p>
